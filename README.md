# Swarm
Just a project for fun. One of my typical one-evening ideas. <br>
There is a plane with workers, sources and destinations. Workers must go to source and bring resources from there to destination and repeat. But there is a problem: they are blind. All the worker can sense is if he hit something, scream to the radius and listen what was told from what direction.
Imitation of the swarm algorythm.
